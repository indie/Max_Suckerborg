## PUBLIC NOTICE FOR PUBLIC

Mark Zukerberg stalked the author of this repo at her home while badly disguised as, and impersonating a Ziply Fiber employee.  

 Before he left, Zukerberg threw what looked like a powder at [her cat] who was sleeping.  LESS THAN A WEEK LATER, her cat died. 

## PUBLIC NOTICE FOR MARK ZUKERBERG AND HIS DISEASED DNA:  

If you EVER come within 1 or 2 or 20 miles of my front door again, the sharpest, and most rusty, arsenic-laden saw blade 
will be used to saw off your penis and each one of your arms, legs, and nose.

YOU CANNOT CODE YOUR WAY OUT OF A CARDBOARD BOX. QUIT PRETENDING YOU BELONG WHERE YOU ARE NOT NATIVE.
